Other stuff you can add:
	-and, or,xor,ushr,shr,shl
	-++a vs a++. for one of them, you need to do super.load twice so you can put the value of 2.0
	-cr mutator (a-1,a+1,1,0,and one more...)
	-

M1:
	a -> DUP -> a a ->IFNONNULL
		isnull -> pop2 and pop for putfield
		isnotnull dup_x2, super for putfield

		isnull xconst_0 for getfield
		isnotnll super

M2: classvisitor
	override 
	public methodvisitor visitmethod()
	{
	classmethods.owner=name
	classmethods.methodinfo.add()
	}







	________________

if you insert a mutation, and it provides more green, it means it fixed a bug that was in the program.


if you successfully do m1, you should be able to fix a bug in apache commons.

remember not both mutations happen at the same time. Only one happens. EX: x+y will be (++x) + y then x + (++y)
